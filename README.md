DSA LAB ASSIGNMENT 

📘 DSA Assignment

Course: Data Structures & Algorithms
Instructor: Hamza Jawed
Instructions:
● ❌ Do NOT use Java built-in collections
● ✅ Implement all data structures from scratch
● 📌 All functions must be called from main()
● 📊 Mention time complexity where asked

🔹 Question 1: Doubly Linked List (DLL)
Implement a Doubly Linked List from scratch and perform the following operations:
Required Operations
1. Insert elements at the beginning: 10, 20
2. Insert elements at the end: 30, 40 ,5,50,
3. Display the list:
○ Forward traversal
○ Backward traversal
4. Delete:
○ First node
○ Last node
5. Delete a node by value (20)
6. Delete the node that appears before a given value (deleteBeforeValue(30))
7. Delete the node that appears after a given value (deleteAfterValue(20))
8. Find and display minimum and maximum values in the DLL
📌 Constraints:
● Handle edge cases (head, tail, value not found)
● Maintain both next and prev pointers correctly
📊 Mention time complexity of insert, delete, min, max operations.

🔹 Question 2: Queue Implementation
Part A – Queue using Array
Implement a Queue using an array with dynamic resizing.
Operations:
● Enqueue
● Dequeue
● Peek
● Display Queue
● Find minimum and maximum elements in the queue
Insert elements:
10, 20, 30, 40

(Initial array size = 3)
📌 Show how resizing occurs.

Part B – Queue using Linked List
Implement a Queue using a Linked List.
Operations:
● Enqueue
● Dequeue
● Peek
● Find minimum and maximum values
📊 Compare Array Queue vs Linked List Queue in terms of:
● Time complexity
● Memory usage

🔹 Question 3: Searching Algorithms
Given the sorted array:
{3, 8, 12, 20, 25, 30}

1. Implement Binary Search (Iterative) to find 20
2. Implement Binary Search (Recursive) to find 25
3. Implement Recursive Linear Search to find 12
4. Find minimum and maximum values using recursion
📌 Mention:
● Why binary search requires sorted data
● Time & space complexity of recursive approaches

🔹 Question 4: Recursion Problems
Solve the following using recursion only:
1. Find factorial of 5
2. Find Fibonacci number at position 6
3. Find sum of array elements:
{2, 4, 6, 8}
4. Check whether the array is sorted:
{3, 5, 7, 9}
5. Find minimum and maximum element of an array using recursion
📌 Clearly mention base case and recursive case.

🔹 Question 5: Sorting Algorithms
Given the array:
{5, 1, 4, 2, 8}
1. Write Merge Sort
2. Write Quick Sort
3. Compare Merge Sort vs Quick Sort based on:

○ Time complexity
○ Space complexity

🔹 Question 6: Binary Search Tree (BST)
Insert the following elements into a BST:
50, 30, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80

Perform the following:
1. Print:
○ Inorder traversal
○ Preorder traversal
○ Postorder traversal
2. Search element 60
3. Delete node 80
4. Find minimum and maximum values in the BST
5. Count:
○ Total nodes
○ Leaf nodes
● Tree height
